# GUI Demo of Image Display
## Description
This is another exercise in PyQt5 I came up with to practice displaying images in a GUI, as well as updating those images when necessary. By default, the "Use Button" radio-button is selected, which allows user to press button to load images of the next house. When "Cycle" radio-button is selected, the button is disabled and the houses cycle automatically every 1500 ms.

Pictures sampled are from houses dataset: https://github.com/emanhamed/Houses-dataset

### To get this running:
* Download both .py files, put in same directory
* pip install the PySide2 package
* Open command prompt to directory, type "python image-test.py"
